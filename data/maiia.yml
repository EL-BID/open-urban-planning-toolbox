 MAIIA is an AI algorithm that allows for the automated mapping of informal urban settlement locations through the analysis of satellite images. It was developed with an emphasis on ease of implementation, to lower the barriers to access artificial intelligence tools and enable government agencies, researchers, and other interested parties to apply it to their own use cases.
